= X11

The `x11` target outputs an X11-compatible xkb file.
This is the default mechanism for processing key codes and handling multiple keyboard layouts.
(Despite its name, it is also used on Wayland.)

NOTE: For a list of all supported properties of the Android target files, see <<TargetX11>> in the reference section below.

== Layout-level configuration and properties

Currently none.

== How to install a new locale on X11

CAUTION: The X11 output should be considered experimental. It requires modifying global X11 files, and might eat your cat.

. Install files system-wide by copying them into `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols`

. If you are installing a new locale, it needs to be added to "rules set"
which is what configuration tools use to pick up which locales are available.
+
These files can be found in `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/`,
but sadly, this is quite the exercise, as the files are supposed to be auto-generated.
For testing purposes,
editing the `layoutList` section of `evdev.xml` manually
(by duplicating an existing section)
should be fine.
The `configItem/name` should be same as the file name,
and `variantList` should have a `variant` where the `configItem/name`
is the name of the `xkb_symbols` block.

. Clear the xkb cache,
either by running `sudo rm /var/lib/xkb/*.xkm`,
or (on Debian systems) `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data`

. Add the locale to your set of available ones
using Gnome Settings or a similar tool.
Use the "Show Keyboard Layout" button to preview the layout.
You might need to log out and in again for the new settings to apply correctly.
