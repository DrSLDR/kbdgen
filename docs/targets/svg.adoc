== SVG

This target exists for the purpose of visualising and debugging keyboard layouts
during development. An HTML index file is generated, including all SVGs necessary
to demonstrate the project.

The SVGs show each mode, and the corresponding ISO key code for the mapping. This is
especially useful for correcting missing key errors.
