= Transitioning from kbdgen 1.x to 2.x

== Fundamental differences between kbdgen 1.x and 2.x:

* A directory layout is now enforced in the form of a project bundle (ie "foo.kbdgen/")
* Layouts are no longer specified in the project.yaml, and are instead determined by a `layouts/` directory inside the bundle
* Layouts no longer have an "internalName", and instead are designated by their locale
* Layouts no longer require separate layout files for each platform, and are now only separated by locale distinctions
  * This means that you can have one layout file containing multiple targets, limiting duplication of such things as transforms and dead keys
* The command line interface has been improved and made easier to understand
  * Each target has its own flags and help information
* Target resources are now constrained to a `resources/` directory inside the project bundle
* More helpful error messages when resources are missing
* Improved support for iPad and the introduction of new modes for supporting these layouts
* The introduction of the `m17n` and `chrome` targets
* The inclusion of tools to simplify generating template projects from CLDR keyboard sources

== Converting a kbdgen 1.x project to 2.x

This is a work in progress. For now, you may use the Node.js script in our GitHub repository.

There are some known issues with this script. Current known issues:

* TODO

We intend to integrate a `convert` command to the kbdgen tool Soonâ„¢. If you wish to help port
this functionality to the Rust codebase, please let us know in this issue. TODO
