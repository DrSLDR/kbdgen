# Introduction

The `svg` target outputs a pretty SVG of your keyboard layouts. It is especially useful to see if the keyboard you are designing is beginning to work as expected. It has not special configuration and outputs the SVG files, with an `index.html` to the `build/` directory.

# Dependencies
